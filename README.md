## Hangarin Lottery problem


## Problem statement
This problem is related to the Hungarian lottery. In case you are not familiar with it: players pick 5 distinct numbers from 1 to 90.
There is a weekly lottery picking event when the lotto organization picks 5 distinct numbers randomly between 1 and 90 – just like the players did.
A player’s reward then depends on how many of the player’s numbers match with the ones selected at the lotto picking. 
A player wins if they have 2, 3, 4 or 5 matching numbers.

Now, the problem: at the lottery event, right after picking the numbers, a computer shall be able to report quickly 
that how many winners are in each category, for example:

This report shall be generated as soon as possible after picking the winning numbers. 
The players' numbers are known a few minutes before the show starts. In peak periods, there are currently about 10 million players.
